+ Air Quality Predictions - India
  - Our project aimed to analyze air pollution in India. To predict the situation in the next year (2023). It turns out that winter is the most polluted time of the year. Pollution levels decrease during the summer and monsoon seasons. The lowest contamination levels were recorded in August and September. Air pollution in June 2022 was the highest compared to June in the last five years. Two of our forecast models indicate that there will be no change in the air pollution levels and one of our models indicates that the pollution levels would slightly decrease. Due to such discrepancy, we cannot make any strong claims regarding predictions and would possibly need a different machine learning model to achieve substantial results.

+ Application of Amino Acid Property Grouping Technique to Predict Protein Function Using Natural Language Processing Algorithms
  - Diverse biological processes are orchestrated by proteins, the fundamental building blocks of life, utilizing distinctive amino acid sequences. Traditional methods for determining protein function are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, computational tools, particularly those rooted in Natural Language Processing (NLP), offer a promising alternative for efficient protein function prediction. This paper reviews the information-based and common NLP algorithms and techniques along with the amino acid property grouping technique. A significant focus is placed on the application of NLP techniques, acknowledging the complexity of deciphering the intricate language of proteins. Despite the multifunctionality of proteins and evolutionary nuances, NLP-based approaches show potential for accelerating protein function
identification, with direct implications for drug discovery, personalized medicine, protein engineering, and bio-manufacturing. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the amino acid property grouping technique's impact on predictive capabilities across different machine learning algorithms. Results indicate that this technique, when integrated with specific algorithms, holds promise in enhancing predictive accuracy. The study concludes by proposing future directions, emphasizing the need for further analyses,
alternative sampling techniques, and leveraging high-performance computing. It suggests exploring the transformative potential of the Transformer algorithm in protein function prediction, with the possibility of integrating a specialized encoder based on amino acid property grouping. This comprehensive exploration aims to contribute to the evolving landscape of computational methodologies in deciphering and predicting protein functions, holding immense promise for advancements in biological research, medicine, and biotechnology

+ Applications of Machine Learning - Esports
  - The projects sought to mimic the tasks of a data analyst hired by an e-sports team. Some such objectives included analyzing game data from various events and predicting high-value champions as well as players utilizing the logistic regression algorithm. Additionally, various machine learning and deep learning algorithms were applied to develop a stronger understanding and discern patterns in gameplay among the players and teams

+ Likelihood Of College Admissions
  - Our objective was to conduct data analysis and search for characteristics that are crucial for forecasting the likelihood of admission. Our goal was to forecast both the GRE results and the chance of admission. Our findings indicate that a studentâ€™s GRE and cumulative GPA have the biggest effect on their chances of being admitted. Additionally, we were able to create a model that could forecast GRE scores based on TOEFL results, GPA, and whether the student had any prior research experience. Subsequently, we developed a model that could predict the likelihood of admission based on research experience, GRE scores, the quality of letters of recommendation cumulative GPA, and university rankings. 

+ Queue Optimization For Airport Security
  - This project addresses the challenges faced by airport security checkpoints in optimizing passenger throughput while maintaining stringent security measures post-9/11. The TSA seeks to investigate and resolve issues such as tracking passenger flow, addressing high variability in wait times across airports, and considering cultural and behavioral factors impacting security checkpoint experiences. The objective is to provide policy recommendations that balance security standards and passenger convenience, offering globally applicable or adaptable solutions to enhance efficiency and reduce wait time variances at airport security checkpoints.

+ Threat Identification
  - The Project aims to investigate a fictional white-collar crime involving embezzlement and internet fraud within a software company, employing a network-based approach. With 83 nodes, 400 links, and 15 topics, the goal is to prioritize potential conspirators, considering known individuals and suspicious message topics. The analysis successfully identifies 18 suspects, including senior managers, emphasizing the need for caution in interpreting flagged activities. The model's adaptability extends beyond crime scenarios to applications such as virus propagation tracking in biological networks, showcasing its potential in diverse fields and contributing innovative insights.

+ Viral Sequences for crops DB
  - An attempt at creating a database by gathering relevant sequence data for viruses that infect various crops like Rice, Corn, Wheat, etc.
