## What is League of Legends? {.smaller}

League of legends is defined as a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena)

-   Where two teams of five champions each controlled by a player go head to head against each other in order to secure a win by taking out the enemy nexus. 

-   A champion refers to the player character. There are 164 champions currently in the game. Each champion is unique and posses different and unique abilities.

-   The players are responsible for acquiring objectives and killing the enemies to order to generate a lead.

## What is League of Legends? (Cont.){.smaller}

-   League have a number of different maps the players can play on. However, the map that is the most played and is used for competitive play is known as Summoners rift.

</center>

-   Traditionally, based on the location on the map each player is assigned a specific role with the exception of bot lane where there are two players

- Often, the second player in the bot lane is referred to as support. Every other player's role is simply the part of the map they play on.

## League of Legends as a E-sport {.smaller}

-   Riot games hosts one of the biggest e-sport tournaments with a prize of $2.5 million every year.

-   This year alone the viewer count for just the finals games alone was over 5.1 million views. 

-   Many of the teams employ the use of Data Scientists in order to gain an advantage. 

-   Winning can result in brand deals and merchandising for the winning team.

## Drafting Champions {.smaller}

- As mentioned, before the actual game begins the players select what champions they wish to play in a match

- Before the champions are picked however, there is a champion banning phase where players ban champions they don't wish to play against. There are a total of 10 bans each game.

- A champion can only be picked once between the two teams. Each player tries to pick the best champion. 

- Picking the right champion in a professional game can make the difference between a win or a loss.

## Project Goals

-   The overall goal of the project was to simulate being a data scientist for one of the teams and working on some of the projects a data scientist would encounter.

    +   In-order to accomplish that our first objective is identifying champions that our team would like to prioritize.

    +   Identifying the optimal champions for the players to pick.

    +   Trying to determine the winner of a game before the game even occurs.

## The Data Set{.smaller}

-   To archive our goals we will be utilizing the data set obtained from [Oracleselixir](https://oracleselixir.com/)
-   The Oracleselixir dataset contains end game information for every game that was played this year from January to November 
-   The information was collected by taking the end game results from LoL-Esports.com. 
-   For every game the datasets first presents performance of each player per game. 
-   Then the dataset shows a cumulative team data for the two teams that played that game. 
-   There a total of 116 variables and 147,865 rows of observations in our data set

-   The plot here show cases the top 30 champions at the world championship with a high pick rate, win rate, and low ban rate. Based on the plot we can make the following assumptions:

-   Sejuani, Sylas, Azir, Aatrox, and Aphelios were the most prioritized champions.

-   Some of the other champions to look out for are Nami, Lulu, Leona, Jax, and Varus.

## Best Champions for a Player (Model assessment){.smaller}

-   Multiple Logistic Regression
    +   Predictors: Champions played.
    +   Target variable: Win if playing the champion.

-   Equation can be given as:
$$P(Win)={e^{(-0.19+0.034*{Champion_1}) + (-0.19-0.112*{Champion_2})...} \over 1+e^{(-0.19+0.034*{Champion_1}) + (-0.19-0.112*{Champion_2})...}}$$

-   Accuracy scores ranged from 59% to 100%
    +   More champions a player plays the harder it is for our model to predict accurately.
    +   Predictions can be improved by getting more data for the player.

### Model Tests

-   Our model's accuracy score is given as 70%
-   We can use our model to determine a winner between T1 and JD Gaming.
    +   The probability of win for T1: 57.82%
    +   The probability of win for JD Gaming: 52.75%
-   Hence, we can assume that T1 would win based on a higher probability.
-   T1 did in fact win against JD Gaming at the world championship semi-finals.

### Model Issues

-   If we apply our model for the teams T1 and Cloud 9
    +   Probability of win for T1: 57.82%
    +   Probability of win for Cloud 9: 57.02%
-   The probabilities are too close to one another.
-   There is no change between the probabilities for T1 since its the mean total gold earned by the team.
-   Needs more variables to be reach 95% accuracy or greater.  

:::

## Moving Forward

-   Working on improving the accuracy for our models
-   Since our data set is massive we can try and answer other questions. Such as,
    +   Game times in professional play.
    +   Players that had a high impact at the World championships.
    +   Differences between high and lower region tiers.
-   Using different types of models and trying various other techniques.
