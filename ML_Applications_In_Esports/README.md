Abstract: The popularity of electronic sports has steadily grown in recent years. Esports can provide financial and social opportunities to players and team owners.
The games played in e-sports are usually highly accessible to fans. As the popularity
of e-sports has grown, so too has the amount of data available on the games played.
This paper explores some of that data in regards to a specific game, League of Legends. Can interesting observations about the current state of the game be drawn
from the data? Yes. Specifically, combinations of heroes frequently picked together
can be observed. Can the data highlight ways in which players can improve their
game? Yes. The data is able to show which features contribute to widely used performance metrics and players can take actions to improve their performance in the
contributing features and the final metric. Can the winner of future matches be predicted based on their recorded game data? Partially. The dataset examined here is a
good start to predicting the winner of a match, but more data is needed to successfully model a game as complex as League of Legends. This paper shows evidence of
how data analytics will play a significant role in future professional e-sports competitions.
